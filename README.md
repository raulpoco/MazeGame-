<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project


The project was built to practice some JavaScript concepts, such as Algorithms, DOM manipulation, using loops and many other things.
It was built with the help of a course, but also from my ambition to learn as many new things related to JavaScript as possible. 
I think this project helped me a lot

Here's why:

* It helped me to understand an algorithm and why it is important to be implemented within a project
* I deepened the array methods and understood some new aspects related to 2-dimensional arrays
* It was super fun to build and motivated me every time to go through new concepts :smile:
* I also learned a new Matter Js library with which I will be able to make new games in the future



This project is used only for the purpose of theoretical and practical training for deepening the notions and concepts related to JavaScript.


### Built With

The application was built with the help of a framework: 
<br>

<img alt="Matter.js" src="https://brm.io/matter-js/img/matter-js.svg" width="300">

> *Matter.js* is a JavaScript 2D rigid body physics engine for the web

[brm.io/matter-js](https://brm.io/matter-js/)


<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

The application can be deployed to be used or tested locally

### Prerequisites

A keyboard and a laptop/pc is required for the game to be functional.

The keys used in the game are W, A, S, D and up arrow, down arrow, right arrow and left arrow



### Installation

No instalation needed.

<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap

- [x] Creating the borders, the walls and the shapes required for the game 
- [x] Add functionability to the games ( behavior via JavaScript)
- [x] Add a win condition and a reload game
- [ ] Add the ( newbie, beginner, normal, hard ) levels
- [ ] The user can choose how complex the maze should be:
    - [ ] Changing the number of "walls"
    - [ ] Changing the location of objects
    - [ ] Changing the colors of the object
